# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis:
In this project, we looked at the math, reading and overall schools for all schools in the district. We looked the average scores and passing percentages for the schools both individually and based on their school type (district or charter), school size, and spending budget per student. 

The dataframes were created based on data in the original file, as well as data in the original file apart from ninth grade math & reading scores of Thomas High School students. 


## Results:
When the ninth grade data was included in the first report, it showed that the percentage of students who passed math and reading were approximately 67% and 70% respectively.

However, upon extracting the 9th grade data, the percentage of students who passed math and reading increased to approximately 93% and 97% respectively. This also raised the overall passing percentage from 65% to approximately 91%.

**Additional Changes**
* Thomas High School is a medium-sized school, so the scores of small and large-sized schools were unaffected. However, the percentage that passed math and reading were adjusted to 88% and 91% respectively in the updated dataset.

* Thomas High School falls into the $630-644 per student spending range category. The overall passing percentages in this category increased from 56% in the original data to 63% in the updated version.
* Thomas High School is a charter school. The percentage passing scores for charter schools didn't show any significant difference between the original and updated datasets.

The biggest changes when updating the dataset were the percentage of students who passed math (67 to 93%), those who passed reading (70 to 97%) and the overall percentage (65 to 91%). This also mean that the table for the highest performing schools changed, and Thomas High School rose to second place.
